# Gold Badge Challenges

Gold Badge Challenges is a file that contains 3 Console Applications for Eleven Fifthy Academy Software Development Bootcamp. The prompt is to create seperate console apps for each challenge as a capstone project for the Gold Badge.
The three challenges in this file are:

1. [Komodo Cafe](#cafe)
2. [Komodo Claims](#claims)
3. [Komodo Badges](#badges)

## Technologies Used

- Visual Studio 2019 Community
- C#
- GitHub

## Installation

It is highly recommended to use Visual Studio 2019 Community. You may download the free application by [clicking here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Usage

#### Cafe
The console app for the fictional cafe store allows you to store and manage menu items. The menu items are sorted numerically for the user, from lowest to highest.

#### Claims
The fictional Komodo Insurance company needed a software application that allows the claims agent to:
1. See all the claims in the queue.
2. Take the next claim in the queue.
3. Enter a new claim and adding it to the queue.
4. Update an existing claim WITHOUT losing its place in the queue.


This console does exactly that for the fictional Insurance company.

#### Badges
Not only did Komodo Insurance request an application for their insurance claims, they requested ANOTHER console application to help manage their badging system.
This console app uses a dictionary to maintain and grant access to certain doors by using their Badge ID number.
You can edit an existing badge by adding or removing doors. You can also see all the keys in the dictionary and their respective values.
